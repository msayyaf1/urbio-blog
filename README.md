## Running the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)

## Design Decisions

### API Integration
- Used RTK Query for all API calls (fetching posts, single post details, creating posts).
- Data fetching optimized with caching and automatic refetching.

### UI/UX Approach
- Built fully responsive layouts using MUI's Grid & Box.
- Used MUI theming for consistent styling.
- Focused on clean, minimal, and user-friendly design.

##  Challenges Faced
